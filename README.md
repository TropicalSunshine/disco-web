### Overview
Disco is a full stack application that utilizes the [microservices architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices#:~:text=Microservice%20architecture%20%E2%80%93%20a%20variant%20of,and%20the%20protocols%20are%20lightweight.) and as a way for me to learn about modern programming practices and designing data intensive applications. So far I have been able to explore topics such as Jest, CI/CD, GraphQL, advanced React.JS, web security, and many more to come.

### About DISCO
